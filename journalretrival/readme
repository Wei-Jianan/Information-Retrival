After it is compile to a jar.
type something like " jave -jar ****.jar -j /Users/jiananwei/Desktop/JSON -q /Users/jiananwei/Desktop/CS7IS3-Assignment2-Topics"
-j follow the path to where json files put,
and for now -q is doing nothing but it should be specified.

path must be absolute path!
after 1-2min there will be a directory "temp/index" built.
